It is said that patience is half of faith, as mentioned by Abdullah ibn Mas'ud. The Qur'an is filled with verses that praise the patient and show how Allah loves them. Patience is also a condition for success in the Hereafter.</p>" +
        "<p>In our day-to-day lives, we are tested in every way possible, and it is highly important to be conscious of how we face those tests. We might fail to be patient at times, but we need to pick ourselves up and continue practicing patience. We must resist all forms of things that go against what Allah wants for us.</p>" +
        "<p>It is challenging to practice patience, but that’s how it has always been. The best of humans, the Prophets, were tested in the hardest ways. How can we think we will not go through some of what they went through?</p>" +
        "<p>Being patient is a habit that can be taught to the nafs (self). Over time, it becomes stronger, able to endure hard and seemingly impossible things that others cannot. May Allah help us practice patience and make us among the patient.</p>",

               "<p>Every person who builds something meaningful discovers the same secret: freedom starts with doing what matters in front of people who might not understand.</p>" +
               "<p>Most of us spend years hiding our real work. We pray privately when we could pray openly. We avoid running outside because someone might watch. We build businesses quietly because we fear judgment.</p>" +
               "<p>But there's a moment when hiding becomes more uncomfortable than exposure. When the thing you're building matters more than the opinions of strangers. This is where real freedom begins. Not in perfect conditions or private spaces, but in choosing your values over their comfort.</p>" +
               "<p>The path is practice. Do the thing that scares you. Do it again. Then again. What felt impossible becomes uncomfortable. What felt uncomfortable becomes normal. The businessman who prays openly at work. The writer who shares imperfect thoughts daily. The entrepreneur who builds in public while others whisper.</p>" +
               "<p>They all discovered the same truth: courage isn't the absence of fear. It's the decision that something else matters more. Freedom isn't found in isolation. It's built in public, one brave choice at a time.</p>",

               "<p>As human beings we have our weaknesses. You find yourself in those days where the body and mind are off. Usually it's something you thought you solved but didn't give the proper attention it needed and that bites back.</p>" +
               "<p>Most people think consistency means staying the same. But even robots, who actually do stay the same for years, can't escape power outages. We built them, and our environment affects them too.</p>" +
               "<p>When it feels off and the day is not going as you want, improvise and go again. That's what consistency is all about, not robotic perfection, but human adaptation. The Muslim entrepreneurs building something real know this. Your energy will drop. Your plans will get disrupted. Life will demand attention you didn't budget for. The question isn't whether this will happen. It's what you do when it does.</p>" +
               "<p>Keep improvising, keep building.</p>",

               "<p>Every committed person knows the feeling of being pulled away from what matters. You're building something important. Making progress. Finding your rhythm. Then life intervenes with its demands and deadlines. Today that happened to me with the website. The work was there, waiting. But other responsibilities had their own urgency.</p>" +
               "<p>The tension isn't between important and unimportant work. It's between what matters now and what matters most. Most people give up when this tension appears. They assume it means they're not serious enough, or that their \"real work\" isn't actually real. But the tension is the work. Learning to hold both - the immediate demands and the long term mission without abandoning either.</p>" +
               "<p>This blog exists in that space. Not when everything is perfect, but when everything is competing for attention. Because the goal isn't to eliminate all other responsibilities. It's to keep moving toward what matters, even when the path isn't clear.</p>",

               "<p>Every good writer remembers their first success. Mine was primary school compositions. There's something powerful about discovering you can arrange words in ways that matter to other people. But talent without consistency is just potential.</p>" +
               "<p>The business world is full of smart people who could write, should write, but don't write. They're missing something crucial: the daily practice of turning observations into insights.</p>" +
               "<p>This blog is where I do that work. Not just business insights, but life insights. The small improvements that compound over time. Because the best ideas don't come from thinking harder. They come from observing better.</p>",
