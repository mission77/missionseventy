          <h2>About Mission Seventy</h2>
          <p>Mission Seventy is where I share daily observations about making things work. Every day, I write about what I'm learning from my projects, what I notice about systems and processes, and insights that help turn ideas into reality.</p>
          <p>This is my laboratory for figuring out how to build better, work smarter, and create systems that actually function. The writing here comes from real experience—building projects, solving problems, and discovering what works through trial and refinement.</p>
          <p>If you're interested in the practical side of making progress and the honest journey of turning vision into execution, you're in the right place.</p>
